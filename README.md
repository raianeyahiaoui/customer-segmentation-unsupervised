Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering - Unsupervised Learning Project


🧿 Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Learning – TapToBuy Dataset

## 📌 Project Description
This project implements a complete **unsupervised machine learning pipeline** for customer segmentation using the **TapToBuy** dataset. With increasing competition in the e-commerce space, TapToBuy seeks to personalize its marketing campaigns by clustering its customers based on behavioral and demographic data.

The goal of this project is to **group similar customers** using the **K-Means Clustering algorithm**, visualize these clusters, and analyze their characteristics to drive business insights.

## 🎯 Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

- Clean and preprocess the TapToBuy dataset.
- Handle missing values using imputation techniques.
- Convert categorical data using label encoding.
- Normalize features for clustering.
- Identify optimal number of customer clusters using the **Elbow Method**.
- Apply **K-Means Clustering** to group customers.
- Visualize customer clusters using **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**.

## 📁 Project Overview

The pipeline is divided into the following key stages:

### 1. 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values in both categorical and numerical fields.
- Encode categorical features: Gender, Marital Status, Education, Profession, etc.
- Standardize numerical features: Age, Work Experience, Family Size.

📍 Output: Cleaned and scaled customer data ready for clustering.

### 2. 📉 Clustering with KMeans
- Use the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Apply **KMeans Clustering** to segment the customer base.
- Assign cluster labels to each customer.

📍 Output: Labeled dataset with cluster assignments.

---

### 3. 📊 Visualization with PCA
- Reduce data dimensions to 2D using **PCA**.
- Plot clusters using a color-coded scatter plot.
- Visually distinguish different customer groups.

📍 Output: Cluster plot for analysis and presentation.
